First you need to head to the comic server and run ```npm install```, then create a ```.env file``` with an API key called "API_KEY", finally run the server using ```npm start``` that will proxy the info from the API.

Then you will need to run the front end with the command ```ng serve```. 

After all that set up is done you will be able to test it.
